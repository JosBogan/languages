OK, now you know how to describe efficiency in basic terms. Now it’s time to get more technical.↵↵In the rest of the lesson, we’ll cover five **classes of complexity** in algorithms; in other words, break down the “highly efficient,” “pretty good,” and “inefficient” groups that we just discussed. Here they are:↵↵| Highly Efficient | Pretty Good | Inefficient |↵| --- | --- | --- |↵| Constant complexity | Linear complexity | Quadratic complexity |↵| Logarithmic complexity | | Factorial complexity |
